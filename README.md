## Overview
The system leverages the LayoutLMv3 model from Hugging Face Transformers, which is particularly well-suited for handling complex document layouts. The model combines textual and visual features extracted from documents to perform token-level classification, making it ideal for tasks such as form understanding, invoice processing, and more.

## Installation

To set up the environment and install necessary dependencies:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/document-ai-layoutlmv3.git
   cd document-ai-layoutlmv3

2. Install the required packages:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Dataset
  The model is trained and evaluated using the SROIE Dataset, which includes a variety of scanned receipts with corresponding ground truth annotations.

4. Preprocessing
  Images are preprocessed by converting them to RGB format and resizing them. The LayoutLMv3 processor is used to tokenize the text and align it with the image features.

5. Training
  The model is trained using the following configuration:

  Model: LayoutLMv3ForTokenClassification
  Optimizer: AdamW with a learning rate of 5e-5
  Batch Size: 8
  Epochs: 3 (can be adjusted)
  Device: GPU (CUDA) or CPU
  To train the model:
    python train.py
    
6. Training Script
  The training script handles the following:

  Loading and preprocessing the dataset in batches to manage memory usage effectively.
  Training the model using Seq2SeqTrainer for efficient gradient computation.
  Saving the trained model at the end of the training process.
  
7. Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated using common metrics like F1-score, precision, and recall to measure its performance on token classification tasks.

8. Loads the test dataset.
  Computes predictions and compares them with ground truth labels.
  Generates a classification report with detailed metrics.
9. Inference
  To run inference on new documents:

  Load the trained model and processor.
  Pass a new document image through the model.
  Retrieve and display token predictions.
  Example:
    python inference.py --image_path "path/to/new/image.png"
10. Hyperparameter Tuning
  You can fine-tune the model's hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, to optimize its performance. Consider using tools like Optuna or Ray Tune for automated hyperparameter optimization.

11. Deployment
  The trained model can be deployed using various platforms:  Hugging Face Inference API

12. Future Work
  Model Interpretation: Integrate tools like LIME or SHAP for explaining model predictions.
  Continuous Learning: Set up a pipeline for continuous learning with fresh data.
  Scaling: Optimize the model for faster inference using quantization, pruning, or distillation techniques.
